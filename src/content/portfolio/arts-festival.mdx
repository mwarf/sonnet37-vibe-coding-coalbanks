## Project Overview

The Southern Alberta Arts Festival is an annual three-day celebration of visual arts, music, theater, and dance that attracts over 15,000 attendees. The Arts Council of Alberta needed comprehensive video coverage that would document the 2022 festival for archival purposes, create promotional material for future events, and capture the diverse range of activities and experiences.

## Our Approach

We developed a multi-faceted coverage strategy that included:

- A core team of four videographers positioned throughout the festival grounds
- Dedicated coverage of main stage performances with multi-camera setups
- Roaming documentary teams capturing workshops, art installations, and attendee experiences
- Daily interviews with artists, organizers, and festival-goers
- Aerial footage to capture the scale and atmosphere of the event
- Time-lapse sequences of art installations being created

## The Result

Our coverage resulted in a comprehensive package of video content:

1. **Festival Highlight Film (10 minutes)** - A cinematic overview of the entire festival
2. **Performance Recordings** - Complete documentation of 12 main stage performances
3. **Artist Spotlights** - Five 3-minute profiles of featured artists
4. **Daily Recap Videos** - Three 2-minute videos released each evening of the festival
5. **Social Media Content** - 25 short clips optimized for various social platforms
6. **Promotional Trailer** - A 60-second teaser for the following year's festival

The content was used across the Arts Council's website, social media channels, and in presentations to sponsors and grant committees. The highlight film was also screened at several community events and arts conferences. The Arts Council reported that the video content helped secure a 30% increase in sponsorship for the following year's festival.
