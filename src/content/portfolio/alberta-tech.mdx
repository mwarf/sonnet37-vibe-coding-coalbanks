## Project Overview

Alberta Tech Innovations needed a commercial that would showcase their new agricultural monitoring system in a way that highlighted both its technical capabilities and real-world benefits for farmers. The challenge was to make complex technology relatable and compelling.

## Our Approach

Rather than focusing solely on technical specifications, we took a documentary-style approach that showed the technology in context:

- Interviewed farmers about their challenges and how the technology addresses them
- Captured the technology in use across different agricultural settings
- Demonstrated key features through practical applications
- Used cinematic techniques to make technical details visually engaging
- Incorporated subtle motion graphics to explain complex concepts

## The Result

The final commercial package included:

1. **Main 60-second commercial** - For television and digital advertising
2. **Extended 3-minute product showcase** - For the company website and sales presentations
3. **30-second cut** - For targeted social media campaigns
4. **15-second teaser** - For pre-roll ads and announcements

The commercial helped Alberta Tech Innovations exceed their pre-order targets by 45% and generated significant industry press coverage. The documentary-style approach resonated particularly well with the target audience of agricultural professionals, who appreciated seeing the technology demonstrated in familiar contexts.
