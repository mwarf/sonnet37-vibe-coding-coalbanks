## Project Overview

The Winter Festival of Lights is Lethbridge's signature holiday event, featuring illuminated displays throughout the city center, performances, activities, and community celebrations. The City of Lethbridge commissioned comprehensive video coverage to document the 2022 festival, create promotional material for future events, and capture the community spirit that defines this annual tradition.

## Our Approach

Capturing a winter night festival presented unique technical challenges that required specialized approaches:

- Used low-light camera equipment to capture the illuminated displays without losing detail
- Employed drone photography with custom lighting to capture aerial perspectives
- Utilized slow-motion cinematography to capture falling snow and light reflections
- Implemented weatherproofing techniques for equipment in cold conditions
- Balanced capturing planned events with spontaneous moments of community joy
- Conducted interviews with organizers, performers, and attendees

## The Result

Our coverage produced a comprehensive package of video content:

1. **Festival Highlight Film (7 minutes)** - A cinematic journey through the entire festival
2. **Opening Ceremony Documentation** - Complete coverage of the lighting ceremony
3. **Performance Highlights** - A compilation of musical and theatrical performances
4. **Community Stories** - Short interviews with families about holiday traditions
5. **Social Media Content** - 20 short clips optimized for various platforms
6. **Promotional Trailer** - A 60-second teaser for the following year's festival

The content was featured on the City of Lethbridge's website, social media channels, and local television. The highlight film was also shown at the city council meeting and used in presentations to potential sponsors. Following the release of the video content, the city reported a 25% increase in advance registrations for the next year's festival activities and workshops.
