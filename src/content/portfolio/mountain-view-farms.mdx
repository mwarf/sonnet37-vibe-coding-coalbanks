## Project Overview

Mountain View Farms needed to communicate their multi-generational commitment to sustainable agriculture and quality produce to both wholesale buyers and direct consumers. Our brand story series highlighted the authentic human elements behind their farming practices.

## Our Approach

We spent a full growing season with the Thompson family, documenting their daily operations, challenges, and successes. Our approach focused on:

- Capturing the rhythms of farm life through the seasons
- Highlighting sustainable farming practices in action
- Documenting the family's personal connection to the land
- Showcasing the journey from field to market

## The Result

The project delivered a series of five interconnected brand videos:

1. **Family Legacy** - The history and values of Mountain View Farms
2. **Sustainable Practices** - Their commitment to environmental stewardship
3. **A Day in the Life** - The daily rhythms and challenges of farm operations
4. **From Field to Table** - Following produce from harvest to consumer
5. **Community Impact** - How the farm contributes to the local economy and food system

These videos were used across their website, social media channels, and at agricultural trade shows. The content helped Mountain View Farms secure new wholesale partnerships and strengthen their direct-to-consumer marketing efforts.
