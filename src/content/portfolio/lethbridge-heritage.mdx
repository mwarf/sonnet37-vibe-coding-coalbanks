## Project Overview

The Lethbridge Heritage Documentary project aimed to preserve and share the rich cultural history of Southern Alberta through the stories of long-time residents and historical archives.

## Our Approach

We began by conducting extensive research into the region's history, identifying key stories and individuals who could provide authentic perspectives on the area's development over time.

Our production team spent several weeks filming interviews with local historians, long-time residents, and community leaders, capturing their stories and memories of the region.

## The Result

The final documentary series consists of five episodes, each focusing on a different aspect of Lethbridge's history:

1. **The Coal Banks Era** - Exploring the city's origins and namesake
2. **Agricultural Foundations** - The farming and ranching heritage
3. **Cultural Mosaic** - Immigration and diverse communities
4. **Urban Development** - The growth and changes in the city landscape
5. **Looking Forward** - Contemporary challenges and future vision

The series premiered at the Lethbridge Film Festival and has since been used as an educational resource in local schools and community centers.
