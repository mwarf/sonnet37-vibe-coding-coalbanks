## Project Overview

Southern Alberta Retail Group was undergoing a complete rebrand of their 12-store chain, including new store designs, updated product lines, and an enhanced customer experience. They needed a commercial campaign that would announce these changes and reposition their brand in the market.

## Our Approach

We developed a multi-faceted commercial campaign that highlighted different aspects of the rebrand:

- Captured the new store environments and visual merchandising
- Featured real customers discovering the new shopping experience
- Interviewed staff about the enhanced service approach
- Showcased key product lines and exclusive offerings
- Documented the transformation process from old to new

## The Result

The campaign included a series of commercials with different focuses:

1. **Brand Anthem (60 seconds)** - An emotional piece about the company's evolution and commitment to the community
2. **Store Experience (30 seconds)** - Highlighting the new store design and customer journey
3. **Product Spotlight Series (15 seconds each)** - Four commercials featuring different product categories
4. **Community Connection (30 seconds)** - Focusing on local sourcing and community involvement

The campaign ran across television, digital platforms, and in-store displays. Following the campaign launch, Southern Alberta Retail Group reported a 28% increase in store traffic and a 17% increase in average transaction value. Customer surveys indicated significantly improved brand perception, particularly among younger demographic groups that had previously not engaged with the brand.
