## Project Overview

Alberta Health Services commissioned a documentary series to highlight the unique challenges and rewards of healthcare work in rural communities. The project aimed to recognize the contributions of these essential workers, raise awareness about rural healthcare needs, and support recruitment efforts for hard-to-fill positions in remote areas.

## Our Approach

We took a deeply human approach to this documentary series:

- Spent time building trust with healthcare workers before filming began
- Followed subjects through their professional and personal routines
- Captured the unique challenges of rural healthcare delivery
- Documented relationships between healthcare providers and their communities
- Interviewed patients (with appropriate permissions) about the impact of rural healthcare
- Balanced portrayal of challenges with moments of hope and connection

## The Result

The final documentary series consisted of five 15-minute episodes:

1. **The Rural Doctor** - Following a family physician who serves multiple communities
2. **Emergency Response** - Profiling paramedics covering vast rural territories
3. **Community Care** - Highlighting public health nurses and their preventative work
4. **Mental Health Frontlines** - Exploring rural mental health services
5. **The Next Generation** - Following medical students during rural rotations

The series was distributed through Alberta Health Services' internal channels, screened at healthcare conferences, and used in recruitment campaigns. Selected segments were also broadcast on local television and shared on social media. The documentary received a provincial healthcare communication award and has been incorporated into training programs for healthcare professionals considering rural practice.
