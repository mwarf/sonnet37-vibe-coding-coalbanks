## Project Overview

Prairie Winds examines the growing presence of wind energy infrastructure across Southern Alberta's landscape and its effects on local communities, wildlife, and the regional economy.

## Our Approach

This documentary required a balanced approach to a sometimes contentious topic. We conducted interviews with:

- Local farmers and ranchers
- Wind energy company representatives
- Environmental scientists
- Municipal officials
- Indigenous community members

We captured footage throughout the seasons to show the changing landscape and the visual impact of wind turbines on the prairie horizon.

## The Result

The final 45-minute documentary presents multiple perspectives on wind energy development, exploring:

- Economic benefits and challenges for rural communities
- Environmental impacts and mitigation strategies
- Cultural and aesthetic considerations
- Policy and regulatory frameworks
- Future outlook for renewable energy in the region

The film was screened at environmental film festivals across Canada and has been used as an educational resource by schools and community groups discussing renewable energy development.
