## Project Overview

Lethbridge Brewing Co. wanted to differentiate themselves in the competitive craft beer market by highlighting their deep community roots and commitment to local ingredients. Our brand story focused on the people behind the brewery and their passion for creating gathering spaces through craft beer.

## Our Approach

We developed a documentary-style approach that went beyond typical product showcases:

- Interviewed the founders about their brewing philosophy and community vision
- Captured the brewing process from ingredient selection to final product
- Documented community events and partnerships
- Highlighted customer stories and experiences
- Showcased the brewery's role in local economic development

## The Result

The project delivered a main 5-minute brand film and three shorter social media cuts that:

1. **Told the founder's story** - Their journey from home brewing to opening a commercial brewery
2. **Showcased the brewing process** - The craft and science behind their award-winning beers
3. **Highlighted community impact** - How the brewery has become a gathering place and catalyst for local events

The content was featured on their website, social media channels, and used in presentations to potential retail partners. Since the release of the brand story, Lethbridge Brewing Co. has reported a 35% increase in taproom visits and expanded their distribution to 15 new locations.
