      },
      {
        question: "Do you provide raw footage after the project?",

        question: "What should we prepare before filming day?",

      },
      {
        question: "How do you ensure authentic moments in your videos?",
        answer: "Our documentary approach focuses on creating comfortable environments where genuine interactions can happen naturally. We use a mix of planned and unplanned filming, allowing for spontaneous moments while ensuring we capture the key elements of your story."

      {
        question: "What happens if we need changes after seeing the first edit?",
        answer: "Our process includes revision rounds where you can provide feedback on the rough cut. We typically include 2-3 rounds of revisions in our project scope to ensure the final product aligns perfectly with your vision and goals."

        question: "What equipment do you use?",

      {
        question: "What resolution do you film in?",
        answer: "We typically film in 4K resolution to ensure the highest quality and flexibility in post-production. This allows for reframing, stabilization, and future-proofing your content as display technologies continue to evolve."
