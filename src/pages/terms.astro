      <p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly.

However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</p>
      <p>If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.</p>
      <p>These terms control the relationship between Coalbanks Creative and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.</p>
      <p>If you do not comply with these terms, and we don't take action right away, this doesn't mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>
      <p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p>
      <p>The laws of Alberta, Canada, excluding Alberta's conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the courts of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, and you and Coalbanks Creative consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>
